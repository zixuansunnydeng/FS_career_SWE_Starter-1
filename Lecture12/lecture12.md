# Lecture 12

## Tasks for you
1. Add more fields to the database, such as 
```
priceRange
category1
category2
rating
image_url
```
- So you need to modify `restaurant.py` in order to do so
  - hint: `rating` is `NumberAttribute()`
  - Documentation for different types: https://pynamodb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html#defining-model-attributes
2. `git pull` the flutter repo from our course repo
3. In frontend, call this server's endpoint and see if you can get the same results
